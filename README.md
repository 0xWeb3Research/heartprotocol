## 🌟 What is Heart Protocol?
Heart Protocol is a revolutionary decentralized dating platform built on the Aptos blockchain. It combines the power of blockchain technology with the universal quest for love, creating a unique ecosystem where users can find their perfect match while earning rewards for participating in the matchmaking process.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🔐 Decentralized profiles
- 💰 Earn rewards for successful matches
- 🤝 Community-driven matchmaking
- 🔒 Privacy-focused interactions
- 💸 Token-incentivized participation
- 💖 Passive earning through recommendations

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Create Your Profile**: Users create their profile by providing personal information, interests, and preferences.
2. **Activate Your Profile**: Users activate their profile by staking a small amount of APT tokens.
3. **Become a Matchmaker**: Users can opt to become matchmakers by staking additional tokens, allowing them to recommend matches and earn rewards.
4. **Recommend Matches**: Matchmakers can suggest potential matches for users, earning rewards if their recommendations lead to successful connections.
5. **Like and Match**: Users can like profiles recommended to them. If two users like each other, it's a match! Matched users can chat with each other. 
6. **Earn Rewards**: Successful matchmakers earn rewards for their recommendations, and users earn rewards for participating in the ecosystem.
7. **Passive Earning**: Users can earn a small amount of APT tokens simply by being recommended by other users, even if they don't actively participate in matchmaking.
