# 💞 Heart Protocol
> Find your soulmate and earn rewards for helping others find love in the decentralized world.

## 🌟 What is Heart Protocol?
We're basically mashing up dating apps with crypto rewards, and throwing in a dash of community matchmaking for good measure. It's pretty wild when you think about it - people can actually earn tokens for playing cupid! Even if you're just chilling on the platform, you might score some crypto if someone recommends you. We're not just building another DeFi thing or an NFT project - we're trying to help people find love while earning crypto. 

## ✨ Key Features
- 🔐 Decentralized profiles
- 💰 Earn rewards for successful matches
- 🤝 Community-driven matchmaking
- 🔒 Privacy-focused interactions
- 💸 Token-incentivized participation
- 💖 Passive earning through recommendations

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Create Your Profile**: Users create their profile by providing personal information, interests, and preferences.
2. **Activate Your Profile**: Users activate their profile by staking a small amount of APT tokens.
3. **Become a Matchmaker**: Users can opt to become matchmakers by staking additional tokens, allowing them to recommend matches and earn rewards.
4. **Recommend Matches**: Matchmakers can suggest potential matches for users, earning rewards if their recommendations lead to successful connections.
5. **Like and Match**: Users can like profiles recommended to them. If two users like each other, it's a match! Matched users can chat with each other. 
6. **Earn Rewards**: Successful matchmakers earn rewards for their recommendations, and users earn rewards for participating in the ecosystem.
7. **Passive Earning**: Users can earn a small amount of APT tokens simply by being recommended by other users, even if they don't actively participate in matchmaking.
