Heart Protocol's APT amount is lowered for testing in alpha/testnet, but can be easily adjusted in the contract later. 

## 🌟 What the heck is Heart Protocol?

Okay, so picture this: We took dating apps, sprinkled in some crypto rewards, and topped it off with a dash of community matchmaking. Crazy, right? People can actually earn tokens for hooking others up! And get this - even if you're just chilling on the app, you might score some crypto if someone thinks you're a catch. We're not building another boring DeFi thing or hyped-up NFT project - we're trying to help real people find love (and maybe make some money while they're at it).

## ✨ Cool Stuff We've Got

- 🔐 Profiles that aren't owned by some big tech company
- 💰 Get paid when you play Cupid successfully 
- 🤝 Let the community work its matchmaking magic
- 🔒 Keep your flirting on the down-low
- 💸 Earn tokens just for being active
- 💖 Make money by being hot (aka getting recommended)

## 🚀 How This Crazy Thing Works

1. **Set Up Your Profile**: Tell us about yourself, what you're into, what you're looking for.
2. **Activate**: Stake some APT tokens to show you're serious.
3. **Become a Matchmaker**: Stake more tokens if you want to play Cupid and earn rewards.
4. **Suggest Matches**: Think two people would hit it off? Recommend them and earn if they match!
5. **Swipe & Match**: Like profiles you're into. If they like you back, it's a match! Time to slide into those DMs.
6. **Ka-ching!**: Successfully play matchmaker? Cha-ching! Tokens for you!
7. **Passive Income, Baby**: Even if you're not actively matching, you can earn a bit just by being someone's type.

## 💻 Get This Party Started

1. Grab the code:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-protocol.git
   ```
2. Set it up:
   ```
   cd heart-protocol
   aptos move compile
   ```
3. Launch that bad boy:
   ```
   aptos move publish
   ```
4. Start messing around:
   ```
   aptos move run --function-id 'your_address::core::create_profile' --args 'string:Your Name' 'string:Your Bio' ...
   ```
